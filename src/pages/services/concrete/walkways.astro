    <Section title="Durable Concrete Walkways That Complement Your Home">
      <p>Concrete walkways do more than guide foot traffic—they connect the different parts of your home’s exterior with structure, safety, and style. At MAC Paving and Sealcoating, we install custom concrete walkways that blend seamlessly into your landscape and elevate your property’s curb appeal.</p>
